A collection of techniques to allow for a workable safari-only developer experience on MacOS.

- MacOS Dock settings: hide by default. You won't need it
- Safari Advance settings: show full website address. URL UX is super important for this
- Change the hotkey in VSCode to close a file. Normally its Cmd+W, I recommend Cmd+E for easy access... Cmd+W closes the tab. https://lmpify.com/how-can-i-change-the-bcwg950
