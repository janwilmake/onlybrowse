# onlybrowse 

If you only browse, you can control your entire digital context with just HTML, JS and CSS; a very powerful combo! This repo contains a collection of techniques to allow for a workable safari-only developer experience on MacOS.

## MacOS Settings
- MacOS Dock settings: hide by default. This gives you space. You won't need it

## Safari Settings
- Safari Advance settings: show full website address. URL UX is super important for this
- Use vertical tabbar Safari. It's easy this way to create lists of repos!

## VSCode Settings

- Change the hotkey in VSCode to close a file. Normally its Cmd+W, I recommend Cmd+E for easy access... Cmd+W closes the tab. https://lmpify.com/how-can-i-change-the-bcwg950
- Alter title of `github.dev`. To make it easier to navigate across repos, this script edits the title to be just the reponame.  https://lmpify.com/how-can-i-make-a-tam-bzexzp0
